# Readme - Code Samples for Chapter 15, Asynchronous Programming

This chapter contains these samples:

* Foundations (changing synchronous methods to async, continuation)
* ErrorHandling (error handling with async methods)
* AsyncPatternsWPF (synchronous .vs. asynchronous, using the asynchronous pattern, event-based async pattern, and task-based async pattern)

The Foundations and ErrorHandling samples show core features of using the async/await keywords with C#.

The AsyncPatternsWPF demonstrates the advantages of the async/await keywords and shows different async patterns that are used with .NET. To run the application, you need to request a BING key and add it to the BingRequest.cs file in the AsyncLib project, and a Flickr app-id to the file FlickrRequest. You can also request just one of these keys, and just enable the corresponding functionality in the application.

To build and run the .NET Core samples, please install
* Visual Studio 2015 Update 3
* .NET Core 1.0 for Visual Studio

Please download and install the tools from [.NET Core downloads](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windows).
